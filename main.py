    ## About APP:
    The application can be used to chat with my resume and recieve answers to your queries.\n
    Chromadb is used for storing the vector embeddings which were created using sentence transformer's all-MiniLM-L6-v2.\n
    We use sentence similarity to return the most matching document from the corpus and provide it as context to the LLM.\n
                         
    The app's primary resource is utilised to create::

    - [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
    - [Langchain](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/)
    - [Vercel Playground](https://sdk.vercel.ai/)
    - [Chroma DB](https://www.trychroma.com/)
    - [Sentence Transformer](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2)

    A big thanks to [ADING](https://github.com/ading2210) whose module [vercel-llm-api](https://pypi.org/project/vercel-llm-api/) makes all of this possible.
